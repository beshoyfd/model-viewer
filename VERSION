    Removal of canonical GLTF copy + EmissiveStrength and Clearcoat extensions (#4319)
    
    * EmissiveStrength and Clearcoat extensions
    
    Change from MeshStandardMaterial to MeshPhysicalMaterial
    
    * Add Clearcoat Normal Texture Scale
    
    * Remove canonical GLTF element from ThreeDOMElement
    
    Single source of truth is now the three.js scene graph
    
    * Cleanup for space-opera tests
    
    * Address review comments.
    
    * Reverted tests after adding name functionality
    
    * Remove unused `|null` in some ThreeDOMElements
    
    textureInfo, material, and threeDomElement still require them for Lazyloading (assigning the correlated amterial after the constructor)
